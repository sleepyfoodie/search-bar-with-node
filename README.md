Things that could be improved:
Coding optimization -
UI library - could have other choices that are better off
Loading spinner could be improved

Part 1: Walkthrough your solution:
Walkthrough what you built from very high level to detail
Being able to talk about what you did, think out loud, trade offs, pros and cons - why this method to handle features instead of others
How you problem solve, how you think about problems

After describing what you built and answer questions, team will ask certain questions regarding your solutions more specifically  
1. How would you deploy this application?
2. How would you fix certain bugs/errors
3. Also, what are some things you could add (ie. if I wanna add this modal or side panel, how would you add it?)

The more you prepare how you built and how to improve it, the better it is
